# Arxiv
Arxiv class for generating and storing arxiv papers. 

Currently this class is used to create an arxiv API compatible search query, generate papers from that search query,
filter based on date and a user defined filter (to be implemented) and then the results are downloaded locally.

This is part of a larger project to automatically pull arxiv papers and e-mail them to myself (as part of a learning project to learn how raspberry pis work).
